Task 1
Copy the program given below. Save (as lc.cpp), compile and run it.


// Length Converter
// converts a given length in meter (m)
// into: mm, cm, dm, ft, yd and in.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define FT 3.280839895013 // foot
#define YD 1.093613298338 // yard
int main()
{
 double x;
 const double IN = 1.0e+2/2.54; // inch
 enum { MM = 1000, CM = 100, DM = 10 };
 cout << "Input a length in meters: ";
 cin >> x;
 cout << "This length is " << endl;
 cout << x*MM << " mm" << endl;
 cout << x*CM << " cm" << endl;
 cout << x*DM << " dm" << endl;
 cout << x*IN << " inch" << endl;
 cout << x*FT << " foot" << endl;
 cout << x*YD << " yard" << endl;
 return 0;
}

Task 2
i) Write a program to compute the result of the given equation.


Task 3

For the given circuit, write a C++ program to input the potential difference between
points a and b (Vab) and to output the current passing through each resistor. (Between point a and b, Resistances are connected as : R1 and R2 are parallel to each other (R1//R2)  and R3 series to these two resistor.)
In the program, using const keyword define the resistances which are assumed to be R1 = 1 kΩ, R2= 2 kΩ and R3 = 3 kΩ

An example output is given below:
Input potential difference, Vab: 150
Calculated currents in Ampere
i1 = 0.0272727
i2 = 0.0136364
i3 = 0.0409091
