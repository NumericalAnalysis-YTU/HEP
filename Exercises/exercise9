* Modify program below such that it also outputs the minimum and maximium values of the temperatures recorded in the file kelvin.tmp.
// Reading data from a file with a check for is_open()
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main ()
{
  string filename = "kelvin.tmp";
  ifstream kelvin(filename.c_str());
  double k;

  if (kelvin.is_open())
  {
      double s;
      int i;

      cout << "Reading data from file: " << filename << endl;
      for(s = 0.0, i=0; i<100; i++, s += k )
         kelvin >> k;
      kelvin.close();

      double mean = s/100.0;

      cout << "mean of the data = " << mean << endl;
  }
  else
    cout << "Unable to open file " << filename;

  return 0;
}
* Write a program that outputs to a file called numbers.dat the integer numbers 1 to 100 and their square-roots. The output should be formatted as illustrated below.

  2  1.414
  3  1.732

The file gravity.dat contains the following measured values for the acceleration due to gravity. Write a program to input the data into an array and output the mean value to the screen.
9.81
9.79
9.83
9.79
9.90
9.82
9.84
9.78
9.85

The file student.dat contains the names and corresponding exam scores of 20 students in a class (the data is given below). Write a program which reads the data from the file and calculates and outputs a) the mean score of the class excluding zeros and b) the name and score of the students getting the maximum and minimum score.

What is the output of the following program?
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int i = 1;
  while(i<=10)
    cout << setw(4) << i++ << fixed
         << setw(6) << setprecision(2) << log(i)
         << setw(6) << setprecision(2) << log10(i) << endl;
  return 0;
}


What is the output of the following program?
// Program to show that the maximum power delivered to the 
// load resistance R occurs when the load resistance
// matches the internal resistance r (namely R = r)
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  double R=0.0, r = 1.0e+3, Rmax = 5.0e+3;

  cout << scientific << setprecision(1);

  do{
    double power = 100.0* R/(R+r)/(R+r);
    cout << setw(9) << r << setw(9) << R
         << setw(9) << power << endl;
    R += 500;

  }while(R <= Rmax);

  return 0;
}
