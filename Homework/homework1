Prepare your own working environment! 

At least you should be able to compile a program and run it. 

Try out the tricks given in the previous slides; perform the speed test as in the previous slide. What will happen if you add the debug option (-G) to your compiler? 

It could be also interesting to check the size of the output executable Ô¨Åles with different compiling options. 
 
If you did not write any C/C++ code for a while, please refresh your memory before next week!

*  Write a program with output: "Hello MSc students"

* Write a program named triangle.cpp to input the base b and height h of a right-angle triangle, and output its area.

* Write a program named circle.cpp to input the radius r of a circle and output the circumference of the circle.

* Write a program to input kinetic energy K in MeV of a free  electron (with mass me = 0.511 MeV/c) and 
outputs the momentum in MeV/c and de Broglie wavelength in nanometers of the electron. Use relativistic
kinematics.
