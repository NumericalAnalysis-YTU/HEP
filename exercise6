Exercises

* What is the difference between arguments passed by value and by reference?
* What is recursion?
* What is function overloading and polymorphism?
* What is the difference between a macro function and an ordinary function?

* Write a recursive function called unsigned fib(unsigned n) that returns the n'th element of the Fibonacci series: 
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
Each number, after the second, is the sum of the two numbers before it.

* Write a program that inputs an integer number n and an integer power p and outputs n p. The calculation should be done using a recursive function named int power(n, p).

* What do you expect to be the output of the following program? Compile and run the program, is the output what you expected? If not, explain why.
#include <iostream>

int foo (int =1);
double foo (double);

int main(void)
{
  for(int i=0; i<20; i+=3){
    int x = foo();
    int y = foo(i-x);
    double z = foo(1.0*i);
    std::cout << x << '\t' << y << '\t' << z << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}

int foo (int a){
  if (a > 1) return (a * foo (a-1));
  else return 1;
}
double foo (double a){
  if (a > 1.0) return (a * foo (a-1.0));
  else return 1.0;
}
